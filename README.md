# Wave Simulator

This project is a **Wave Simulator** built with **React** and **Vite**. It provides an interactive platform for visualizing traveling and standing waves on transmission lines. Users can manipulate various parameters such as frequency, wavelength, and voltage to observe how these changes affect wave behavior.

## Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Visualize forward and backward waves, as well as the resultant wave, in real-time.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust parameters like frequency, wavelength, and voltage to see their effects on wave propagation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive controls for easy manipulation of wave parameters.
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Displays important metrics such as reflection coefficient and voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR).

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel. You can access it [here](https://standing-travelling-wave-stimulation.vercel.app/).
